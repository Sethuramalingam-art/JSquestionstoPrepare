Do not store the token in localStorage, the token can be compromised using xss attack.
 I think the best solution will be to provide both access token and refresh token to the client on login action. save the access token in memory (e.g redux state) 
and the refresh token should be created on the server with httpOnly flag (and also secure flag if possible). 
The access token should be set to expire every 2-3 minutes. 
In order to make sure that the user will not have to enter his credentials every 2-3 minutes I have an interval which calls the /refreshToken endpoint before the 
current token expires (silent refresh token).

that way, the access token cannot be compromised using xss/csrf. but using an xss attack, the attacker can make a 
call on your behalf to the /refreshToken endpoint, but this will not be harmful because the returned token cannot be compromised.

Useeffect vs useLayouteffect

useeffect ia async  - it will not delay the  painting the dom into the browser
uselayouteffect is sync - it will delay the painting the dom into the browser

It is useful to be aware of the steps that component re-render takes in order to comprehend when the hooks are called. 
Assuming that the useEffect hook is active in our app, we can get this series of events to happen.

The user engages with the React app. Let’s just say the user clicks a button on the UI.
The state of the components changes.
The DOM is then mutated.
Changes are then reflected on the browser screen.
The function is invoked to clean up effects from the previous render if useEffect dependencies have changed.
Following cleanup, the useEffect hook is invoked.

For the useLayoutEffect hook, the series of events will be
